F\\# is an excellent functional _first_ programming language: it's functional (of course), it has a clean and readable syntax (without a lot of fancy symbols and such), it's flexible (in case you need to understand some other paradigm in the middle of your code) and is concise enough to express your ideas clearly.\n", "\n", "Learning a new language _and_ a new programming paradigm is a wonderful adventure. It doesn't need any special preparation, although I assume the reader has experience in at least one popular language (say C, Python, Java, or JavaScript, for example). I hope you enjoy your journey as much as I did when I started F\\# a few years ago. Remember to program and make mistakes, because that is where learning is transformed.\n", "\n", "F\\#, like any other computer language, has its own syntax and quirks that you need to understand. But learning the functional paradigm requires letting go of some concepts that one is very fond of and uses in everyday programming in imperative or object-oriented languages.\n", "\n", "> This difference has deep roots in the very origin of computing.\n", "> In the beginning, there were two mutually equivalent formal computing approaches, one developed by Alan Turing with his [computing machine](https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230), while the other was developed by Alonzo Church with his [computing machine](https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230). Both approaches evolved in parallel and gave rise to different branches of programming styles.\n", "> Functional programming is not new at all. LISP, the first functional programming language, appeared in 1958, barely a year before its release.\n", "> imperative counterpart, Fortran.\n", ">\n", "> In a very broad sense, learning a functional language is like traveling back in time, going back through the imperative branch of programming and taking the other exit off the roundabout.\n", "\n", "Even if you don't ultimately embrace the functional paradigm, adding a new language style to your assets will give you the experience to look at old programming habits with fresh eyes, giving you a deeper understanding and fine-tuning of your code. You will become a better programmer, definitely!\n", "\n", "F\\# is one of the languages \u200b\u200bprovided by the .NET Framework (along with C# and Visual Basic). As such, F\\# is tightly integrated with all the tools and libraries provided by .NET. But in this approach, I'll look at .NET as the set of libraries that one can use to improve their code. In other words, I'll stay away from using them and focus on the main features of F\\# as a functional language. From web programming to machine learning, from databases to Windows, .NET has everything you need to make your programming a better experience, once you understand the core features that F\\# provides.\n", "\n", "Also, my goal is to keep it as simple as possible, because I'd like the reader to have the fundamental set of language tools to play with. To that end, some concepts are left out on purpose and will be revealed in the future.\n", "\n", "> If you're a C# programmer, you'll probably get better performance using some of the great F\\# resources for C# programmers, like [Get programming with F\\#](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-f-sharp#:~:text=about%20the%20book-,Get%20Programming%20with%20F%23%3A%20A%20guide%20for%20.,of%20functional%20programming%20in%20F%23.)\n"]}, {"attachments": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Tools\n", "\n", "This series covers the basics of F\\# programming, and none of the examples even require F\\# to be installed.

These concepts generally translate to _variables_ and _routines_ (or any other names, such as procedures or functions, depending on the scope of your programming), respectively. In this way, one uses routines to change the variables, or create others, from an order to buy something on a website, to the color of a pixel in your preferred game.\n", "\n", "But let's go back and start with _expressions_.
