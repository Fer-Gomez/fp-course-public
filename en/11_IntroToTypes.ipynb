We have also seen how functions can be combined. That's the first thing about defining functions: how they behave and how you can encapsulate this behavior in one or more functions that can be composed to produce results. In our example, the behavior of our `VendingMachine` is to give you some product once you have provided enough money and selected your gift with a keyboard.\n", "The second aspect that is _necessary_ to define the function is what type of inputs and outputs it has. Going back to our first example, one had a table representing the `carColor` function, with the color of each car parked on a block. A completely different function would be `carHorsePower`, where for each car on the block, you write the power. Clearly here the inputs of both functions are the same, the license plate, but the outputs are different. If our vending machine does not accept paper tickets but credit cards, the input will be different, but you will still get your dear chips, i.e. the outputs of `vendingMachine` and the modern `vendingMachineWithCreditCard` are the same type, but the inputs They are different\n", "\n", "Then, to fully define a function, you need to specify (code...) the behavior of the function _and_ the types of inputs and outputs. These are two sides of the same coin, and one cannot live without the other. And that's where the code needs to correctly represent the type of inputs and outputs in the real world. And that's where the language gives you the tools to define these types.\n", "\n", "How to define the type of inputs and outputs of your functions? To get started, you typically write a bulleted list of all the relevant features of them. In the case of the colors of the cars on the block, the inputs are the license plates which are usually letters and numbers, so in our code model, that would be some kind of string of characters. What about the departures? Usual color names can be used, as we did. That would be represented by a collection of `strings`.\n", "\n", "> Or, one can get more detailed and use the [that each car model has](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g28196287/wildest-paint-colors-for-sale/) color names. That would be a more complete collection of colors, but this would also affect the inputs of our function, because now we also need the name of the car model. Going further, the color name probably changes with model years, so we would need that as well.\n", "\n", "> \u2753 Can you think of the inputs and outputs of a `carModel` function?

As we all know, computers only understand bits 0 and 1 at the lowest level, however they are typically presented as _byte_ chunks of 8 bits each. Putting together bytes you can have the basic types of all languages, such as integers and floats in all their variations (signed or unsigned integers, integers of different sizes, floats of different sizes). Other basic types, such as strings or characters, even booleans, depend on how each language implements them.\n", "\n", "All contemporary languages \u200b\u200bcan construct compound types using these basic types. For example, if we need to model a wallet, we will need a way to represent bills, credit cards, personal identification, etc. Each of these elements in turn must also be modeled, and so on. Therefore, the wallet will be represented as a hierarchical aggregation of simpler models that, at the bottom of it, will resort to basic types.\n", "\n", "There is also another aspect of modeling real world entities with types. Let's go back to our examples and examine how we can map each of our model properties to simpler types. Clearly, a credit card holder's name can be a string of characters, the expiration date is, well, a date.\n", "How about the type of product? In principle it can also be a character string as well. However, it seems that one can be more specific: for a food vending machine, one can list the possible types of food:\n", "\n", "- French fries\n", "- chocolate\n", "- dulce\n", "\n", "etc. There are also vending machines for electronic products, so you would have to\n", "\n", "- telephone\n", "- speakers\n", "- headphones\n", "etc.\n", "\n", "The list can be long, but one can probably write it down on a page (or maybe it's provided by your vending machine customer).\n", "\n", "It seems that one can classify the characteristics of the inputs and outputs more broadly. For one thing, a credit card holder's name and expiration dates are huge charges that cannot be determined _a priori_. On the other hand, we have some features that belong to a well-predefined group of different cases (car colors, product types). Also note that these two type types can be combined into inputs or outputs, just like in the wallet model.\n", "\n", "One of the best features of F\\# is that it provides precise ways to implement these two types.
