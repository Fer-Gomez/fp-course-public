It was described as a _functional-first_ programming language, although in the latest iteration, the tagline was changed to _a universal programming language for writing succinct, robust and performant code_. Like many other languages ​​(such as Java), it was originally created as a corporate effort within Microsoft, but fortunately became [open sourced](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp), with the great advantage that there is a large ecosystem of tools and libraries built on top of .NET. You can read the genesis of the language [here](https://fsharp.org/history/hopl-final/hopl-fsharp.pdf).\n","\n","## Why F#\n","\n","Here are some features that F# exhibits as _a language_:\n","\n","### It is a multi-paradigm language\n","\n","When programming in F#, a functional approach will be presented _first_, which can be easily extended to include object-oriented and/or imperative styles. You can mix and match paradigms based on the specific needs of your code.\n","\n","### F# is a strongly typed language\n","\n","This means that one needs to know in advance what kind of value one is storing in each expression (Note that I'm _not_ talking about _variables_. More on that later). However, the usual experience when programming in F\\# with a modern IDE is that you do not program by yourself only, the compiler is a friend that is continually inspecting what you are writing, and decides whether the appropriate type definition is explicitly needed or not. For the vast majority of lines of code one does not need to set the data type because the compiler infers it correctly, but it's very useful for your teammates or future self to do so.\n","\n","### F# is a compiled language\n","\n","You'll be dealing with the usual edit-compile-run _loop_. For more details on how the build process works within .NET, see this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr). But, the language comes with console where [can be programmed interactively](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tools/fsharp-interactive/). Also, if you're used to writing code in an [_notebook_](https://jupyter.org/), you can load an F\\# _kernel_ and use it!\n","\n","Here are some of the benefits you get from _F# being part of .NET_:\n","\n","- It is fully cross-platform.\n","- .NET is a vast library.\n","- It is easy to integrate with other .NET languages, such as C# or VB.\n","- It's open source.\n","- There are great tools available for developing in F#.\n","- It has a huge and friendly community.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Tools\n","\n","This series covers the basics of F\\# programming and is written as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). \n","\n","### Run online \n","\n","Check the [README](https://github.com/fcolavecchia/fp-course-public/tree/main#readme) of the [repo](https://github.com/fcolavecchia/fp-course-public) to run it online in Binder.\n","\n","However, none of the examples even require F\\# to be installed. You can simply copy-paste the code from the lessons in your web browser of choice by going to [Fable REPL](https://fable.io/repl/). Just write your code in the left pane, click the usual play button (or Alt+Enter) and that's it, you're programming in F\\#!\n","\n","## Run on your machine\n","\n","Instructions on how to configure F\\# as the Notebook kernel can be found at [here](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/main/docs/NotebookswithJupyter.md).\n","\n","You can also install the F\\# language and use your daily editor, but you'll need to install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0), available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n","\n","[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has a wonderful extension called [Ionide](https://ionide.io/Editors/Code/overview.html) to work with F\\#. I personally use JetBrains Rider for my daily programming which supports F\\#.\n","\n","You can also use F\\# with Visual Studio for Windows or MacOS, if you're familiar with that tool.\n","\n","Also, if you want to program F\\# with `vim`, [Ionide is also available for `vim`](https://ionide.io/Editors/Vim/overview.html)."]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"},"orig_nbformat":4},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
