It was described as a _functional-first_ programming language, although in the latest iteration, the tagline was changed to _a universal programming language for writing succinct, robust and performant code_. Like many other languages \u200b\u200b(such as Java), it was originally created as a corporate effort within Microsoft, but fortunately became [open sourced] (https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp), with the great advantage that there is a large ecosystem of tools and libraries built on top of .NET including choose. You can read the history of the [here](https://fsharp.org/history/hopl-final/hopl-fsharp.pdf) language.\n", "\n", "## Why F#\n", "\n", "Here are some features that F# exhibits as _a language_:\n", "\n", "### It is a multi-paradigm language\n", "\n", "When programming in F# a functional approach will be presented _first_, which can be easily extended to include object-oriented and/or imperative styles. You can mix and match paradigms based on the specific needs of your code.\n", "\n", "### F# is a strongly typed language\n", "\n", "This means that one needs to know in advance what kind of value one is storing in each expression (Note that I'm _not_ talking about _variables_. More on that later). However, the usual experience when programming in F\\# with a modern IDE is that you don't program by yourself, the compiler is a friend that is continually inspecting what you are writing, and decides whether the appropriate type definition is explicitly needed or not. No. The vast majority of lines of code don't need to set the data type and it infers correctly, but it's very useful for your teammates or future self to do so.\n", "\n", "### F# is a compiled language\n", "\n", "You'll be dealing with the usual edit-compile-run _loop. For more details on how the build process works within .NET, see this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr). But, the language comes with console where [can be programmed interactively](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tools/fsharp-interactive/). Also, if you're used to writing code in an [_notebook_](https://jupyter.org/), you can load an F\\# _kernel_ and use it!\n", "\n", "Here are some of the benefits you get from _F# being part of .NET_:\n", "\n", "- It is fully cross-platform.\n", "- .NET is a vast library.\n", "- It is easy to integrate with other .NET languages, such as C# or VB.\n", "- It's open source.\n", "- There are great tools available for developing in F#.\n", "- It has a huge and friendly community.\n"]}], "metadata": {"language_info": {"name": "python"}, "orig_nbformat": 4}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
