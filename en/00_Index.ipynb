F\\# is an excelent _first_ functional programming language: it is functional (of course), it has a clean and readable syntax (not a lot of fancy symbols and stuff), it is flexible (in case you need to grasp some other paradigm in the middle of your code) and it is concise enough to express your ideas with clarity. \n","\n","Learning a new language _and_ a new programming paradigm is a wonderful adventure. You do not need any special preparation, although I assume that the reader has some background in at least one popular language (let us say C, Python, Java or JavaScript, for example). \n","\n","Since these guides are entirely written as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try), you will get the most of the course by running them. Yes, it is possible to run F\\# in a Jupyter notebook interactive environment, which is fantastic for learning. \n","\n","The course can also be accesed as a read only content in [Programación avanzada](https://ibprogramacionavanzada.github.io/), en español.\n","\n","> The course was produced originally in spanish, the english version was generated automagically, and edited manually. If you need the course in other language, you can use [nbTranslate](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/nbTranslate/README.html), a [Jupyter notebook extension](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions) that creates multilanguage notebooks by translating the content using google translate.
