With a big difference from other approaches, this book starts with a full example in F# that is througly discussed, and _then_ presents the elements of the language in the next chapters.\n", "\n", "- [Beginning F# 4.0](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-1374-2), by Robert Pickering and Kit Eason.

By the very same creator of the language, it also showcases the flexibility of F# to adopt different programming paradigms.

Is not just a compiler, but a way to use these languages together. Depending on the recipe you would like to prepare, add the ingredients at your own pleasure.
