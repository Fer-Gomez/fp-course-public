A glimpse to it will reveal some features of the language (and the .NET ecosystem) that need to be introduced.

Bear in mind that F# is a _flexible_ language, and has some features that can enable one to write mutable code and object oriented classes. Although this drifts apart to some extent from a more pure functional paradigm, it is important at this point to recognize that one can deal with mutability in F#, the key is to take control of mutability where it is convenient, and proceed with functional style, when it is convenient too. \n","\n","Anyway, in this exercise, we aim to transform the code to a full functional inmutable version."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"metadata":{"dotnet_interactive":{"language":"fsharp"},"polyglot_notebook":{"kernelName":"fsharp"},"vscode":{"languageId":"polyglot-notebook"}},"outputs":[],"source":["open System.Collections.Generic\n","\n","type Item = \n","    {\n","        Name: string\n","        SellIn: int \n","        Quality: int \n","    }"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["First thing first, the type `Item` is a typical record, no big deal here.

completeness, I transcribe [the following paragraphs from the documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/classes#when-to-use-classes-unions-records-and-structures), which hopefully clarify the use of types and classes:\n","\n","Given the variety of types to choose from, you need to have a good understanding of what each type is designed for to select the appropriate type for a particular situation. Classes are designed for use in object-oriented programming contexts. Object-oriented programming is the dominant paradigm used in applications that are written for the .NET Framework. If your F# code has to work closely with the .NET Framework or another object-oriented library, and especially if you have to extend from an object-oriented type system such as a UI library, classes are probably appropriate.\n","\n","If you are not interoperating closely with object-oriented code, or if you are writing code that is self-contained and therefore protected from frequent interaction with object-oriented code, you should consider using a mix of classes, records and discriminated unions. A single, well thought–out discriminated union, together with appropriate pattern matching code, can often be used as a simpler alternative to an object hierarchy. For more information about discriminated unions, see Discriminated Unions.\n","\n","Records have the advantage of being simpler than classes, but records are not appropriate when the demands of a type exceed what can be accomplished with their simplicity. Records are basically simple aggregates of values, without separate constructors that can perform custom actions, without hidden fields, and without inheritance or interface implementations. Although members such as properties and methods can be added to records to make their behavior more complex, the fields stored in a record are still a simple aggregate of values. For more information about records, see Records.\n","\n","Structures are also useful for small aggregates of data, but they differ from classes and records in that they are .NET value types. Classes and records are .NET reference types. The semantics of value types and reference types are different in that value types are passed by value. This means that they are copied bit for bit when they are passed as a parameter or returned from a function. They are also stored on the stack or, if they are used as a field, embedded inside the parent object instead of stored in their own separate location on the heap. Therefore, structures are appropriate for frequently accessed data when the overhead of accessing the heap is a problem. For more information about structures, see Structs.\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"},"orig_nbformat":4},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
